    <h1>My name is Katie Slade</h1>
    <p>I was born and grew up in Utah. 
        I am the second daughter in a family of seven. 
        I met and married Chris Slade while we were attending BYU in Provo. 
        We have four children: three boys and one girl. 
        We moved to Laie in 2007 and have enjoyed living here near the ocean and warm climate.</p>
    <p>I <strong>LOVE</strong> learning! 
        One of my interests is learning about other people and lands in the world. 
        Chris and I have enjoyed watching the series <em>The Amazing Race</em>. 
        It was fun to see so many different places. 
        Our family also participated in something called <em>Univeral Yums &reg;</em> where we tried snacks from many different countries. 
        During COVID, our family also enjoyed learning about different countries and would read about, eat foods from, and watch movies taking place in different countries.
        </p>
