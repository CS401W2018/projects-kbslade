    <main>
        <p>I have many people that I look up to: my parents, my grandparents, and many more.</p>
        <p>The "hero" I have chosen to spotlight is my grandma <span class="navy">Ruby Collard Bedke</span>. Today (September 23) is her birthday. She would have been 103!
        </p>
        <p>Something that I learned and really valued in my Grandma was her ability to connect with people and show love to people. 
            She lived with my family for a time and I remember sitting and talking with her, one on one. When she moved to her own house, she would invite me over the "help her" clean, prepare her house for visitors, or make food. 
            She taught me to make strawberry rhubarb pie, her special icebox cake, fruit fluff salad, as well as how to make a bed. 
            She taught us grandkids how to play cardgames, how to deal cards the "right" way, and how to win or loose the game graciously. 
            Once, she asked me to drive her to pick up a walker or something and we ended up going to a movie together too. I loved my time with Grandma and felt really noticed and loved. 
            Years after she passed away, my cousins and I sat together and talked about Grandma. 
            What was amazing was how we all thought we were her favorite grandchild. She had such a gift and was a gift to all of us.
        </p>
        <p>
            My Grandma was a hard worker. I have memories of her working in her garden, making food for our family, and always making sure we had what we needed.
