                <h4>Oldest 2</h4>
                <p>These two boys have been in competition with each other since they were little. When they were really little, the younger brother would watch the older brother and then try to do everything he did. They seem to be less competitive now and hopefully are becoming friends as they get older.</p>

                <h4>Younger 2</h4>
                <p>These two have been good friends since our daughter was born. Our daughter will go to our son when she's scared and he'll take care of her. Hopefully they'll continue to be good friends throughout their lives. </p>
