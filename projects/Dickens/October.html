        <p>Charles Dickens is a famous author from England. He wrote his novels, short stories, and comics in the Victorian Era (1830s-70s) and is known for his social critics and writing challenging topics such as poverty, illness, and social class in society. I've really enjoyed his stories and characters, how he weaves different story lines and characters together.</p>
        <p>Over the summer, I learned of a show on Amazon Prime Video called Dickensian. My sister told me about how she enjoyed the show as they mix the different characters from Charles Dicken's novels together in a story. I love period pieces, so this really appealed to me. The problem is, I don't remember the characters from Dicken's novels to even know what characters they are referring to or to know if they're true to the character.
        </p>
        <p>I decided that perhaps I needed to read the books (or listen to the audio books). My son and I tried to read <em>Oliver Twist</em> last year and I was reminded why I don't love reading Dickens. Though I love his stories, his stories can become quite redundant as they were originally written as a series in the newspaper during his time. I was reminded, though, that there are many of his books that have been made into movies and series. Therefore, I decided to watch, rather than read, to prepare to watch the Amazon series <em>Dickensian</em>. </p>
