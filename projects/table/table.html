            <h3>Why Cats?</h3>
            <p>Our family has a pet cat named Skye. Skye is somewhat friendly. She likes to be around us, but prefers us not to touch her much. She's not afraid to pull out her claws, scratch and hiss. I chose to do a page about cats because my daughter suggested it. She loves our family cat, but also wants a cat of her own. She has been looking at different cat breeds to have a cat someday that will allow her to cuddle and pet it.</p>
