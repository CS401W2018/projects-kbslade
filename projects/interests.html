         <h1>My Interests: My Family</h1>
    </header>
    <main>
        <p>As I contemplated what my interests are, I found that many of my interests come from the people I love to be around: my family! I enjoy many things, but I think I enjoy them most!
        </p>
        <h3>Chris:</h3>
        <p>Chris is my awesome husband of 18.5 years! He's super smart, kind, athletic, and fun to be with and go on adventures with. 
            He is really good at figuring things out, taking care of our computers, cars, and helping keep things in order and calm.
            He's an excellent dad! When our kids were small, he'd come home to go play with them outside. 
            Now that they're older, he is involved with helping them on science projects, watches Minecraft videos with them, and helps them with their math.
            Chris enjoys surfing and stays current with the political issues. 
            Through him, I now enjoy watching surfing too and like to hear what he has to say about the current political and news events.

        <h3>Jared:</h3>
        <p>Jared is currently 17 years old and is a senior at Kahuku High and Intermediate. He likes sports, hanging out with friends, and having fun. For better or for worse, he has always been <strong>determined</strong> and driven to do things once he gets his mind set on it. For example, he decided he wanted to learn about paper airplanes. He spent weeks watching YouTube&trade; videos, used paper to fold hundreds of planes. He's a pretty fun kid to be around! I enjoy learning about and sharing his interests with me.</p>
        <h3>Ryan:</h3>
        <p>Ryan is currently 15 years old and is a sophomore at Kahuku High and Intermediate. He enjoys being with his friends, playing video games, watching videos and reading. When Ryan was young, he really loved pretending to be a superhero (wearing a Superman costume everywhere we went). He loved playing as a Jedi with soft lightsabers, hitting and fighting with others, and sometimes just swinging it around in the air. Lately, he's been a little more subdued - he won't bust out fighting moves, but still enjoys fighting on video games. He is a good kid and works hard in school. My hope is that I can understand him better and what he needs to feel happier with me and our family.</p>
        <h3>Aaron:</h3>
        <p>Aaron is currently 13 years old and is in 7th grade at Kahuku High and Intermediate. He enjoys reading, learning, video games, D&D with friends, and doing well in school. He has been quite a calm and patient son. He has always desired to play with and has fun with his older brother Ryan, but has also really has been such a kind friend to his younger sister Lanea. Lately, he has wanted to read some of the classic novels with me, many of which I have never read. We have read quite an interesting list that includes: <em>Dracula, Tom Sawyer, Huckleberry Finn, Oliver Twist, Pride and Prejudice,</em> and more. He's a fun boy to be around and I learn a lot from him. I hope I never take for granted or develop unfair expectations for his mild temperament. </p>
        <h3>Lanea:</h3>
        <p>Lanea is currently 9 years old and is in 4th grade at Laie Elementary. Being our only daughter and the youngest, she tends to get her way quite often. She enjoys being with friends, animals, doing art or crafts, going to the beach, and playing. I enjoy spending time with her as she still wants me to do things with her, like make friend-ship bracelets, watch girl shows, etc. She is quick to give hugs and show care for others. She is a fun girl to be with.</p>
