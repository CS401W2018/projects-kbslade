        <h2>Using Media in Learning and Teaching</h2>
        <p>There are many different forms of media that can be used to enhance teaching. Since many people learn through different ways, media can be a valuable teaching tool.</p>

        <h3>Pictures</h3>
        <p>Pictures can help students to visualize a concept, give a visual as they listen to a lesson, or provide understanding to a concept. One example is from my religion class. Our teacher showed us a picture he took of Babylonian ruins in the foreground with Sadam Hussein's palace in the background which showed a possible interpretation of the scripture we were studying. </p>
            <div class="imageCard">
                <img src="256px-Saddam-Hussein-Palast_(Babylon).jpg" alt="Babylonian ruins with Sadam Hussein Palace">

            </div>

        <h3>Music</h3>
        <p>Music can also be powerful contributor to learning and teaching concepts. For example, in one of my religion classes about Isaiah, our teacher had us listen to this song. It was a beautiful way that brought the text to life for me and increased in my understanding of it. </p>

        <h3>Video</h3>
        <p>The use of video is also a valuable teaching and learning tool. Watching a video may help people learn or see things in different ways. It's also a way to "change it up" from reading and discussion to </p>
        <p>One of my favorite that has helped me to see different perspectives and interpretations of Jesus Christ and the people surrounding him is from a series called <em>The Chosen</em>. I love sharing this with others as it has helped me to feel closer to Jesus Christ.
        <br>The following is a clip from YouTube&trade;.</p>

        <p>The media page from <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/media?lang=eng">The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints</a> website is also another source. It contains video clips with inspiration messages from church leaders, personal stories, stories for children, segments of scripture that have been dramatized, and much more. </p>
