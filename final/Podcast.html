        <h2>Ideas from Podcasts</h2>

        <p>One of my favorite podcasts is called <a href="https://followhim.co"> <em>Follow Him</em></a>. There are two hosts, Hank Smith and John Bytheway, who discuss sections of scripture with different scholars of many different areas of study, from archaeologists, linguists, human and family scientists, psychologists, professors of religious studies, etc. Though I've enjoyed just about everything and learned a lot, the following are some of my top favorite ideas to share with others.  </p>
        <blockquote>
            "...That's the beauty of a covenant community...No one knows all this stuff. But between all of us, we can know a lot of stuff."
