                    This website was designed to bring together into one place some resources to help as I learn new concepts, teach my family and other youth, and share with others.

                <p>I am a mom of 4 and married to my favorite person. I enjoy going on walks with friends, the beach, being with family. I love studying the gospel of Jesus Christ and helping others to love it too. I currently work with youth and am always looking for fun ideas to do with them and with my kids. This site is a compilation of some of my favorite ideas surrounding gospel study.</p>
