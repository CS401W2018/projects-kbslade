        <h4>What is the difference between a block and an inline tag? Give examples of each one.</h3>
        <p>A block takes up the full width and always starts on a new line. Block example: div, header, and footer tags.</p>
        <p>An inline tag or element, doesn't need to start on a new line and takes up only the space necessary. Inline example: a, span, and img. </p>

        <h4>What is normal flow in HTML?</h4>
        <p>Normal flow is the way that the block and inline elements are displayed on the page before any layout is changed.</p>

        <h4>What does float do? Why do you need to clear the float?</h4>
        <p>A float allows text to flow around an image. </p>
        <p>You need to clear the float because the different elements (that may not even be within the same hierarchy) will share the line, so, for example, your header or footer lines may have paragraph elements on them or the footer moved up with the paragraph.</p>
        
        <h4>What do absolute, fixed, and relative do?</h4>
        <p>Absolute: The box or image is positioned in a specific or exact location. It can even be on top of another box or text.</p>
        <p>Fixed: the image or header or whatever you choose to be fixed will stay in one place as you scroll.</p>
        <p>Relative: the elements are positioned relative to one another. The spacing is determined by the other/previous element. </p>
        
        <h4>How can you make nice navigation buttons for mobile devices?</h4>
        <p>You can make the links into larger buttons, so that when they tap it, it's not such a small little space.</p>
        <p>You do this by first, putting the links in an ul. Then, on the CSS styles page, you change the ul style to 'none' (to take off the bullet points). Then you display them 'inline'. Then you can add "<a>" and do the different specifications (like make a block, etc.) the way you want it to look. </p>

        <h4>Where can you find videos to review what we talked about in class?</h4>
        <p>You can find the videos on canvas when you push "home" then you can see the engagements and videos that go with them for each section. </p>
