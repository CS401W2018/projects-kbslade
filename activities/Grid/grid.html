        <h4>How much time should you spend on an engagement assignment after class? </h4>
        <p>Spend as much time as you need. You can do good and multitask and get it done in class. If you need to look at the video, you can do that too. But you aren't expected to spend a lot of time on the engagement.</p>
        <h4>What should you focus on during class and after class?</h4>
        <p>Focus on what he's teaching and the concepts he's demonstrating during class. Then, if you have questions or need further help and practice, you should go through the lecture notes after class.
        </p>
        <h4>What is the main difference between CSS Grid and CSS Flex?</h4>
        <p> A grid is a lot like a table with rows and cells. The grid sets up the rows and columns.
        </p>
        <p> In Grid: Parent is not flexible. Dictates where the "kid" (items) go. 
            In Flex: The kid gets to determine their own size. Flex is easier. </p>
        <h4>Other notes:
        </h4>
        <p> When adding a grid, you need to set the display to grid. Then, on the next line, in your CSS: "grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr;", the number of 1fr you add is the number of columns you want. In this example there are 3 "1fr", so there are 3 columns. The 'fr' stands for fraction, so it divides the columns evenly. If you want one column wider or less wide than another, then you can put in your own px length, like "150px 300px" - it'll still have 3 columns, but the first will be 150px, the second 300px, and the third will be as wide as the page/parent.
