        <h4>What you learned about Flex and CSS.</h4>   
        <p> Flex is not as rigid as the grid. I learned you can move the items around easier- or justify-content, to the center, or put space around, etc. 
        </p>
        <p>I learned that you can validate CSS!</p>
        <h4>Why do you need to have an accessible website? What does that mean?
        </h4>
        <p> Like buildings, we need to try to make sure we're accessible to people with disablilites, mostly people with vision issues. Websites where the company or person is earning money need to be accessible. 

        </p>
        <h4>Other Notes:
            "flex-flow: row wrap;" does the same thing as these two rows of code: 
            "flex-direction: row;
            flex-wrap: wrap;"
            "justify-content: center;" centers the content.
            "justify-content: space between;" adds space between items.
            "justify-content: space around;" also puts space in the beginning and the end.
