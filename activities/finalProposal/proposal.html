        <h2>1. Gospel Study and Teaching: Youth</h2> 
        <p>2. One thing I love is studying the gospel. I also enjoy teaching it and sharing with others. I am currently an adult youth leader in my ward as well as have 3 children who are currently youth, the last will be soon enough. I'd like to create a resource site to collect some of my favorite and most shared ideas as well as find some new ideas to use as I work with youth and others.</p>
        <p>3. My website will include the following:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>On the home page, I plan to introduce the purpose of the page.</li>
                <li>On pg 1, some of my favorite scriptures regarding certain topics.</li> 
                <li>On page 2, I will put some of my favorite gospel ideas that I've shared from my favorite podcast, <em>Follow Him</em>, particularly ideas that pertain to youth.</li>
                <li>Page 3 will include some time stamps and references to my favorite video segments for teaching certain concepts.</li>
                <li>Page 4 will have my "Getting to know you" for youth form.</li>
                <li>Page 5 will contain Youth Activity/teaching ideas, expecially those associated with scriptures and will have a table listing those activities.</li>
            </ul>
        <p>4. I will create a <strong>form</strong> for my new young women to collect information about them: like what their birthday/age, favorite thing to do, color, hobbies, interests, etc. In the <strong>table</strong>, I'll list out either some favorite activity ideas or things associated with lessons (like object lessons and/or attention-getter games).</p>
        <p>5. I will collect information and content for the site mostly based on my notes from other classes, personal experiences, and gather other resources from some of my favorite websites, such as: churchofjesuschrist.org, followhim.co, possibly thechosen.tv. I plan to only use pictures that either I own or that are open in the public domain. </p>
        <p>6. I have read and understand the warnings about the final project. I will not plagerize or use content illegally. I will cite sources, and not copy anyone else's html, etc. </p>
