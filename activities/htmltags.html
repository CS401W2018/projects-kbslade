   <p>President Nelson said: </p>
   <blockquote>
        Think Celestial. Coventant Path. (Blockquotes indent...I added the indent on the html)
        <hr>
        My dear brothers and sisters, here is my promise. Nothing will help you more to hold fast to the iron rod than <em>worshipping in the temple as regularly as your circumstances permit.</em> Nothing will protect you more as you encounter the world’s mists of darkness. <em>Nothing will bolster your testimony of the Lord Jesus Christ and His Atonement or help you understand God’s magnificent plan more. </em>Nothing will soothe your spirit more during times of pain. Nothing will open the heavens more. <strong>Nothing!</strong>
