        <h2>What kind of photos are good to encode using JPEG?</h2>
        <p>Photos that have a lot of color and detail - like high resolution photos.</p>
        &nbsp;
        <h2>What kind of photos are good to encode using GIF?</h2>
        <p>Pictures that have crisp lines and few colors (blocks of the same color), like logos, animation, etc. as well as smaller pictures.</p>
        &nbsp;
        <h2>What is unique about the PNG format?</h2>
        <p>You don't lose quality when the photo is compressed. It's good for storing high quality photos and images.  </p>
        &nbsp;
        <h2>How do you resize your photo to the size it should be displayed?</h2>
        <p>You use a photo editor you find online.</p>
        <p> Then, when putting it on your page, you can adjust the height or width (or both) by adding an id to the photo, then adding height in the css page. </p>
        &nbsp;
        <h2>Why should you resize photos using photo editing software instead of resizing it using CSS? </h2>
        <p> When you're resizing photos, especially large high quality photos to small, the photo editing software better converts the photos. CSS is more rudimentary compared to using more specialized software.
